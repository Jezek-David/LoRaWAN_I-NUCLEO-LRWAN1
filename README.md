# LoRaWAN_I-NUCLEO-LRWAN1

My project is just about to send data, not to receive, I use an NUCLEO L152RE and the I-NUCLEO LRWAN

USART3 is used for the communication between ST and I-NUCLEO-LRWAN, I don't use USART2 because it's use for debug only (communication betwen NUCLEO and PC)

WM-SG-SM-42 AT Command Reference Manual is very important
